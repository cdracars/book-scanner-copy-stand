# Archive of Original Files

This directory contains the original, unmodified files from the Thingiverse repository for historical reference.

## Original Thingiverse Files

The `original_thingiverse_files` directory contains the exact files as downloaded from the original Thingiverse project created by caj: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2466704

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Verification against the reorganized files
- Compatibility with older documentation that might reference the original filenames

## Important Note

**Do not print from these files directly.** Instead, use the reorganized files in the following directories:
- `models/common_components/` - Components used in all configurations
- `models/single_camera_config/` - Components specific to the single camera setup
- `models/two_camera_config/` - Components specific to the two camera setup
- `models/common_alternatives/` - Alternative parts that work with either setup
- `models/reference_diagrams/` - Assembly diagrams (not for printing)

These reorganized files have been renamed for clarity and organized by function.
