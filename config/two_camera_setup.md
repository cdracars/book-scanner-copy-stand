## Required Hardware

### Glass
- 1× Picture frame glass (11×14 inch recommended)
  - Source: Standard picture frames from retail stores like Walmart
  - The original creator recommends "main stay 11×14" frames from Walmart
  - Most standard picture frames use similar thickness glass
  - Avoid the largest frames as they typically have thicker glass

### Fasteners
- 4× 50mm × 0.5mm screws and bolts (for right and left book stand to make frame sets)
- 8× 20mm × 0.5mm screws and bolts (for connecting bars, new adjustable base to stand base)
- 2× 2 inch × 1/2 inch nuts and bolts (to connect tops to extensions)
- 2× 1/2 inch × 1/2 inch nuts and washers (to connect camera to 2 camera top arm)

### Camera Equipment
- 2× Cameras (DSLR, GoPro, or other camera with at least 10MP resolution)
  - The original creator recommends 4K cameras like GoPro for best results

## Assembly Instructions

1. Assemble the book stand frame:
   - Connect the right and left book stand parts using 50mm × 0.5mm screws and bolts (4 total)

2. Attach the connecting bars:
   - Use 20mm × 0.5mm screws and bolts (8 total) to connect the bars and adjustable base to stand base

3. Assemble the camera mount:
   - Connect the tops to extensions using 2 inch × 1/2 inch nuts and bolts (2 total)
   - Attach cameras to the top arms using 1/2 inch × 1/2 inch nuts and washers (2 total)

4. Put the glass frame together:
   - Use the glass frame connectors and edging pieces to create a frame for the glass
   - Insert the picture frame glass into the assembled frame

## Usage Tips

1. Position the cameras to capture both pages simultaneously
2. Ensure consistent lighting on both pages to get even exposure
3. Consider using a remote trigger or timer to avoid camera shake
4. For best results, use image processing software to crop and clean up the scanned pages

## Troubleshooting

- If the structure feels unstable, check that all bolts are properly tightened
- If the cameras are not level, adjust the position of the camera mount arms
- If parts don't fit together well, check your printer's calibration and consider reprinting problematic parts
