# Common Components Configuration

This document describes the components that are common to both the single-camera and two-camera configurations of the Book Scanner Copy Stand.

## Required 3D Printed Parts

Print the following parts from the `models/common_components/` directory:

| Component | Quantity | Filename |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Right Book Stand | 2 | right_book_stand.stl |
| Left Book Stand | 2 | left_book_stand.stl |
| Glass Frame Connector | 2 | glass_frame_connector.stl |
| Glass Frame Edging | 3-4 | glass_frame_edging.stl |

## Required Hardware

### Glass
- 1× Picture frame glass (11×14 inch recommended)
  - Source: Standard picture frames from retail stores like Walmart
  - Most standard picture frames use similar thickness glass
  - Avoid the largest frames as they typically have thicker glass

### Fasteners
- 4× 50mm × 0.5mm screws and bolts (for connecting right and left book stand parts)

## Assembly Instructions

1. Assemble the book stand frame:
   - Connect the right and left book stand parts using 50mm × 0.5mm screws and bolts (4 total)

2. Prepare the glass frame:
   - Use the glass frame connectors and edging pieces to create a frame for the glass
   - Insert the picture frame glass into the assembled frame

## Usage Notes

- These components form the base structure for both scanner configurations
- The glass surface provides a flat, transparent support for book pages
- The book stand components help position the book properly for scanning

## Compatibility

These components are designed to work with both:
- The single-camera configuration (see `config/single_camera_setup.md`)
- The two-camera configuration (see `config/two_camera_setup.md`)
