## Notes and Recommendations

1. **Metric vs. Imperial**: This project uses a mix of metric and imperial measurements. Be sure to purchase the correct size fasteners.

2. **Substitutions**: If you cannot find the exact size fasteners, similar sizes may work. For example:
   - 50mm × 0.5mm is close to #10-32 × 2" in US sizing
   - 20mm × 0.5mm is close to #10-32 × 3/4" in US sizing

3. **Bulk Purchases**: Many fastener suppliers offer quantity discounts. Consider buying in bulk if you plan to build multiple units or have other projects.

4. **Local Availability**: Hardware stores worldwide often carry similar fasteners. Bring the specifications with you when shopping locally.

5. **Camera Mount Compatibility**: Ensure your camera has a standard 1/4"-20 tripod mount thread for compatibility with the design.
