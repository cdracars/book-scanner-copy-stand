## Description

This repository contains the files needed to build your own book scanner copy stand. The design allows you to easily digitize books and documents using a camera mounted above a glass surface. Perfect for digitizing books, documents, and other printed materials.

## Configuration Options

The design offers two configuration options:

### Two Camera Book Scanner
- Uses two cameras for faster and more efficient scanning
- Ideal for larger digitization projects
- Requires more printed parts and hardware

### Overhead Single Camera Stand
- Simpler design using a single overhead camera
- More economical option
- Requires fewer parts to print

## Files

This repository includes all the original STL files from Thingiverse, organized in a way that makes it easy to identify which parts you need:

- **Original Files**: All original STL files with their exact Thingiverse filenames are in the `models/stl_files/` directory
- **Configuration-Specific Files**: Files organized by intended use in the `models/single_camera_config/` and `models/two_camera_config/` directories
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive build guides and hardware specifications

## Book Merge Software

The repository also includes the Book Merge software created by the original designer. This software helps with:
- Renaming left and right page images
- Merging left and right pages into a combined view
- Organizing scanned book pages in the correct order

Software documentation can be found in the `software/book_merge/` directory.

## Materials Needed

- 3D printed parts (STL files in the models directory)
- Picture frame glass (11x14 size recommended, available at stores like Walmart)
- Various nuts and bolts (see [BOM.md](hardware/BOM.md) for detailed list)
- Camera (DSLR, GoPro, or other camera with suitable resolution)

## Assembly

Detailed assembly instructions are available in the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) file, which includes:
- Parts list for both configurations
- Step-by-step assembly instructions
- Hardware requirements
- Usage recommendations
