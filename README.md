## Description

This repository contains the files needed to build your own book scanner copy stand. The design allows you to easily digitize books and documents using a camera mounted above a glass surface. Perfect for digitizing books, documents, and other printed materials.

## Configuration Options

The design offers two configuration options:

### Two Camera Book Scanner
- Uses two cameras for faster and more efficient scanning
- Ideal for larger digitization projects
- Captures both pages simultaneously

### Overhead Single Camera Stand
- Simpler design using a single overhead camera
- More economical option
- Requires fewer parts to print

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized to make it easy to find the files you need based on the configuration you want to build:

### 3D Printable Files

- **Common Components**: `models/common_components/` - Parts used in both configurations
- **Single Camera Configuration**: `models/single_camera_config/` - Parts specific to the single camera setup
- **Two Camera Configuration**: `models/two_camera_config/` - Parts specific to the two camera setup
- **Alternative Parts**: `models/common_alternatives/` - Optional parts and variants
- **Reference Diagrams**: `models/reference_diagrams/` - Assembly diagrams (not for printing)

### Documentation

- **Configuration Guides**:
  - `config/common_components_setup.md` - Instructions for the shared components
  - `config/single_camera_setup.md` - Single camera build guide
  - `config/two_camera_setup.md` - Two camera build guide
- **Hardware Information**:
  - `hardware/BOM.md` - Complete bill of materials
  - `hardware/SOURCING.md` - Guide for sourcing hardware components

## Book Merge Software

The repository also includes the Book Merge software created by the original designer. **Note: This software is designed for Windows operating systems.** This software helps with:
- Renaming left and right page images
- Merging left and right pages into a combined view
- Organizing scanned book pages in the correct order

Software documentation can be found in the `software/book_merge/` directory.

## Materials Needed

- 3D printed parts (STL files in the models directory)
- Picture frame glass (11x14 size recommended, available at stores like Walmart)
- Various nuts and bolts (see [BOM.md](hardware/BOM.md) for detailed list and [SOURCING.md](hardware/SOURCING.md) for where to buy)
- Camera (DSLR, GoPro, or other camera with suitable resolution)

## Assembly

Detailed assembly instructions are available in the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) file, which includes:
- Parts list for both configurations
- Step-by-step assembly instructions
- Hardware requirements
- Usage recommendations
