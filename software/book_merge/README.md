# Book Merge Software

**Note: This software is designed for Windows operating systems.**

This software is a companion to the Book Scanner Copy Stand created by [caj on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2466704). The software helps merge and organize scanned book pages.

## Overview

The Book Merge program assists with:
- Renaming left and right page images
- Merging left and right pages into a combined view
- Organizing scanned book pages in the correct order

## Installation

1. Download the software from the Thingiverse project page
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Run the installer
4. Note: When installing on Windows 8 (and potentially other Windows versions), you may receive a warning about the software being from an unknown source
   - Click on "More" and accept the installation
   - This is not a virus, but a standard Windows security feature for non-signed applications

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open the program** after installation

2. **Set up your folders**:
   - Click on the "Left Pages Folder" button and select the directory where your left page scans are stored
   - Click on the "Merge Folder" button to select where you want the merged files to be saved
   - Click on the "Right Folder" button to select the directory where your right page scans are stored

3. **Configure naming options**:
   - Enter a name prefix for the renamed pages
   - Set the starting number for file numbering
   - Note: It's recommended to start with 100 or higher if using older Windows versions, as they list files in alphabetical order rather than numerical order

4. **Process your files**:
   - To rename just the left or right pages separately, use the individual rename buttons
   - To rename and merge all pages in one step, press the "Rename and Merge" button

## Tips

- Make sure your left and right page scans are in separate folders
- Use consistent file naming for easier organization
- Ensure you have write permissions for all selected folders

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the software:
- Verify that all paths are correctly set
- Ensure your image files are in a format compatible with the software
- Check that you have sufficient disk space in the destination folder
